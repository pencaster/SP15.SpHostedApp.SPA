makerlab web app for Office365
===============================

This is a fork from Andrew Connell's sample app.
You can read more about this sample app on his blog 
(http://www.andrewconnell.com/blog/sharepoint-hosted-apps-in-sp-2013-as-single-page-apps) and view the sample in action from my YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtbqVK7Ws3M).

The solution has the NuGet package restore enabled... no packages are included in the repo. However they should be pulled down upon the first build.
